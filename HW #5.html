    World Wide Web: Through the Years

    My web experiences dates back as far as the mid 90’s with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">Geocities</a> pages
    and the fact that the term Geocities is automatically underlined as a misspelled
    word, lets me know that it’s been a while since any modern programmer has
    been on a geocities page in quite some time. In dealing with the web,
    primarily one uses a PC or personal computer for the technologically
    deficient, thanks to Moore’s Law, PC’s have gotten extremely better as
    browsing the web, which has created an increased demand for better and
    faster webpages.

When the web was in it’s infancy, there were two browsers, namely,
<a href="http://netscape-browser.en.softonic.com/">Netscape</a> and
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie">Internet Explorer</a>,
now as of this blog, there are dozens of browsers such as :
<br>
<br>

<ul>
       <li>
           <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>
       </li>

       <li>
           <a href=
           "https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en">Chrome</a>
       </li>

       <li>
           <a href="http://www.opera.com/computer/mac">Opera</a>
       </li>

       <li>
           <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>
       </li>

       <li>
           <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/">SeaMonkey</a>
       </li>
   </ul><br>
</p>

In dealing with the world wide web, one has to be acclimated to constant changes,
different formats, and even different versions of the same website. As the web slowly drifted
away from the archaic days of 56 K modems, web developers and coders have had to make it so
that there is always a realtime presence with the advent of wifi which makes the web
experience virtually a real time experience, the structure and update of websites have had to
adjust to this experience as well.

<a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/"> <b>Flash</b></a> was once the dominating language
when it came to webpages and how interactive they could be with the user, problems ranging
from too many updates, security flaws and overall developer dissatisfaction have rendered
flash an magic relic in the world of the web.

Although observing websites on a PC will give the user the best experience available,
movie-browsing has shown great promise and may lead the way in website and
content viewing moving on.

<p>
The web is now interactive, and all immersive, you no longer need to type www. to get to
<a href="https: //www.youtube.com/">Youtube.com</a> Mobile devices are making it where
    you always have access, websites and their respective apps are intertwined.

 </p>




<p>

The web will be personalized and with additions such as voice command and Artificial Intelligence,
the web will be a personal companion who assist you with everyday tasks.
